# bipred — genetic correlation and polygenic overlap

`ldpred3_auto_bivariate` reports a genetic correlation `r_g` between two traits
and, from the same four-state fit, a MiXeR-style polygenic-overlap summary. This
is the usage-and-guidance companion to the model reference in
[algorithm.md](algorithm.md#bivariate-two-trait-ldpred3): how accurate `r_g` is,
which estimator to use, how to handle overlapping samples, and how to read the
polygenic-overlap output. Cross-trait LD Score regression stays in `ldpred3` and
is used throughout as the independent moment-based cross-check
(`ldpred3.ldsc_rg`, with `LDSCRgResult` and `estimate_sample_overlap`).

## Genetic correlation vs bivariate LDSC

The `r_g` from `ldpred3_auto_bivariate` has an independent external check —
**cross-trait LD Score regression**, `ldpred3.ldsc_rg`
(`E[z₁z₂] = intercept + (√(N₁N₂)·ρ_g/M)·ℓ`). Under realistic reference-panel LD
both are roughly unbiased and the bivariate sampler is ~2× more precise (at true
r_g=0.8, LDSC 0.80 ± 0.031 vs bivariate LDpred3 0.79 ± 0.016) — and, as below,
numerically more robust.

**Across architectures.** Sweeping true r_g over five architectures (shared causal
variants with bivariate-normal effects, both traits h²=0.5). The LD here is
**realistic and non-repeating** — the genome is 25 *distinct* coalescent segments
(m=5000), not a tiled block library — fit from a finite reference panel
(N₁=50k/N₂=20k, 10 reps; `benchmarks/rg_architectures.py`,
`rg_architectures.png`). Representative r_g = 0.0 / 0.4 / 0.8:

| architecture | bivariate LDSC | bivariate LDpred3 |
|--------------|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
| infinitesimal | 0.02 ± 0.11 / 0.40 ± 0.10 / 0.80 ± 0.03 | −0.00 ± 0.07 / 0.39 ± 0.07 / 0.79 ± 0.02 |
| sparse (p=0.01) | −0.02 ± 0.22 / 0.35 ± 0.22 / 0.84 ± 0.08 | 0.03 ± 0.10 / 0.36 ± 0.20 / 0.81 ± 0.05 |
| moderate (p=0.05) | 0.02 ± 0.14 / 0.31 ± 0.12 / 0.79 ± 0.05 | 0.01 ± 0.08 / 0.38 ± 0.10 / 0.78 ± 0.03 |
| polygenic (p=0.2) | 0.00 ± 0.09 / 0.41 ± 0.10 / 0.82 ± 0.06 | 0.02 ± 0.08 / 0.41 ± 0.07 / 0.81 ± 0.04 |
| major locus | −0.01 ± 0.37 / 0.28 ± 0.30† / 0.81 ± 0.08 | 0.05 ± 0.23 / 0.32 ± 0.25 / 0.79 ± 0.05 |

(± is the across-replicate SD over the in-range reps; † marks cells where one of
the ten LDSC reps diverged and was excluded.)

- **r_g is architecture-robust** and **unbiased at r_g=0** (no spurious
  correlation) for both methods — unlike `h²` and `p`, the genetic *correlation*
  largely cancels the LD-mismatch and architecture effects (they hit numerator and
  denominator alike). Both track the full 0 → 0.95 sweep closely.
- **Bivariate LDpred3 is consistently more precise** (full likelihood vs the
  moment regression) — typically ~1.5–2× smaller SD, most visibly on the sparse
  and major-locus traits where the cross-trait signal is carried by few variants.
- **LDpred3 is also numerically robust.** LDSC's `r_g = ρ_g / √(h²₁h²₂)` divides
  by marginal heritabilities, so when a univariate `h²` estimate lands near zero
  (its noisy regime on sparse / major-locus traits) the ratio **blows up** — a
  handful of reps here returned values in the hundreds and had to be excluded
  (the † cells). The bivariate sampler, which models the joint effect covariance
  directly, **never diverged**: on major-locus at r_g=0.6 it gives 0.56 ± 0.13
  where LDSC's surviving reps scatter 0.32 ± 0.61.
- **Running time & memory.** Per fit on this genome (m=5000, 25 blocks, single
  core): bivariate **LDSC ~22 ms**, bivariate **LDpred3 ~0.52 s** (0.44–0.63 s
  across architectures) at a **0.22 GB** peak RSS. So the sampler's precision and
  robustness cost ~25× LDSC's time but stay sub-second and light — LDSC remains
  the instant screen, LDpred3 the accurate estimate.

For a quick first pass, a **marginal** (no-LD) r_g — the moment estimator that
assumes independent SNPs — is already reasonable (unlike a marginal h², which is
useless), because LD inflates the cross-covariance and both heritabilities
*proportionally* and largely cancels in the ratio. Use it as a sanity check,
`ldpred3.ldsc_rg` as a fast LD-correct screen with a confounding intercept, and
the bivariate sampler when precision matters.

## Choosing an r_g estimator

Besides LDSC and the bivariate joint fit, you can read `r_g` off **two
independent univariate `-auto` runs** — the self-normalized genetic correlation of
the posterior-mean effects (`uni_gv`), optionally with a decorrelated
out-of-sample-`r²` denominator (`uni_r2`). `benchmarks/rg_methods.py` compares all
four for accuracy **and running time** (m up to 50k): the **bivariate joint fit is
the most accurate and, per fit, ~5× cheaper than the univariate pair** (which must
run several chains per trait), and it is uniquely robust to **power asymmetry** —
where a strong trait boosts a weak one, the univariate estimators attenuate
(e.g. 0.78 vs true 0.90) while the joint fit stays unbiased. `uni_gv` and `uni_r2`
come out numerically identical, and LDSC — being moment-based — does not attenuate
under asymmetry but is noisier at low `r_g`.

| estimator | when to reach for it |
|---|---|
| bivariate joint fit (default `"gv"`) | recommended — most accurate, ~5× cheaper per fit than the univariate pair, robust to power asymmetry |
| bivariate joint fit, `rg_decorrelated=True` | asymmetric-power pairs (strong trait boosting a weak one) — recovers the weak trait's covariance the same-sweep ratio attenuates |
| `ldpred3.ldsc_rg` (cross-trait LDSC) | instant moment-based screen; no shrinkage attenuation, but noisier at low `r_g` |
| univariate `uni_gv` / `uni_r2` | independent cross-check; attenuates under power asymmetry |

The theory (why each works, the scale-matching principle, and why "calibrating"
the denominator with `h²` *fails*) is in
[algorithm.md](algorithm.md#the-genetic-correlation-estimators-theory--trade-offs).

## Polygenic overlap (MiXeR-style)

The bivariate fit's four-state mixture also yields the quantities MiXeR reports —
the shared-causal fraction, the within-shared effect correlation `ρ_β` and the
decomposition `r_g = ρ_β·π₁₁/√(π₁π₂)` — exposed as `res.mixer` (see
[algorithm.md](algorithm.md#bivariate-two-trait-ldpred3)). The overlap fraction
and `r_g` decomposition are reliable; absolute polygenicity is under-calibrated
(dominated by LD-reference mismatch) and should be read as relative
(`benchmarks/mixer_overlap.py`).

To put the absolute counts (`n_causal`, `n_shared`) on a calibrated scale, run
univariate `ldpred3.ldpred3_auto_infer` on each trait and pass the two results to
`res.mixer_calibrated(infer1, infer2)`: it keeps the joint fit's reliable ratios
(`frac_shared`, `ρ_β`) but rebuilds the counts on the univariate learned
polygenicities. Full detail and the benchmark are in
[algorithm.md](algorithm.md#bivariate-two-trait-ldpred3).

## Handling sample overlap

When the two GWAS share individuals, their sampling noise is correlated (`ρ_e`),
which inflates a naive genetic-correlation estimate even for genetically
uncorrelated traits. Both methods have a correction — a free cross-trait
**intercept** in LDSC, and the **`cross_corr`** parameter in the bivariate sampler
— and both work (sparse trait, N₁=N₂=15k fully overlapping, 8 reps;
`benchmarks/sample_overlap.py`). At true r_g=0, mean estimate:

| ρ_e | LDSC (intercept=0) | LDSC (free intercept) | LDpred3 (cross_corr=0) | LDpred3 (cross_corr=ρ_e) |
|----:|:------------------:|:---------------------:|:----------------------:|:------------------------:|
| 0.5 | 0.078 | 0.027 | 0.056 | 0.042 |
| 0.9 | 0.105 | 0.026 | 0.065 | 0.029 |

The uncorrected columns drift upward with the overlap; supplying the correction
(free intercept / `cross_corr=ρ_e`) brings the spurious correlation back to ~0.
The residual inflation is modest here because the LD-aware estimators load the
overlap onto a term (the intercept / the noise-covariance) that is largely
separable from the genetic signal — but it grows with ρ_e, so pass the known
overlap when you have it.

A second benchmark (`benchmarks/sample_overlap.py`, noise correlation ρ_e=0.5,
N=10000, h²=0.3) confirms the correction across `r_g`:

| true r_g | LDSC, intercept=0 | LDSC, free intercept | bivariate, cross_corr=0 | bivariate, cross_corr=ρ_e |
|---------:|------------------:|---------------------:|------------------------:|--------------------------:|
| 0.0 | 0.101 | 0.051 | 0.026 | −0.025 |
| 0.5 | 0.589 | 0.521 | 0.531 | 0.487 |

Uncorrected, overlap biases `r_g` upward (≈+0.03–0.10 at r_g=0); the free LDSC
intercept and the bivariate `cross_corr=ρ_e` each remove it (both corrected
columns straddle zero). If your two GWAS share samples, leave the LDSC intercept
free and pass `cross_corr` (the overlap-induced noise correlation, ≈ the
cross-trait LDSC intercept) to the bivariate sampler.

### Environmental correlation, mechanistically

The sharper worry is two traits whose *environments* are correlated (`re`)
measured on the **same** people: the shared environment makes the phenotypes
correlate with no genetic basis, which a naive estimate would read as genetic.
`benchmarks/rg_env_overlap.py` builds this from real individual-level
genotypes/phenotypes — both GWAS on the same N=20k individuals, genetic effects
correlated by `rg` and residual environments by `re` — and shows the **genetic**
rg is recovered regardless of `re` (20 reps):

| true rg | re | LDSC free intercept | LDSC intercept=0 | LDpred3 cc=0 | LDpred3 cc=ρ |
|--------:|---:|--------------------:|-----------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| 0.0 | 0.0 | −0.03 | −0.02 | −0.02 | −0.02 |
| 0.0 | 0.6 | −0.02 | +0.02 | +0.02 | −0.00 |
| 0.5 | 0.0 | 0.49 | 0.51 | 0.51 | 0.50 |
| 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.48 | 0.53 | 0.53 | **0.50** |

Both corrected estimators recover the true genetic rg (0 and 0.5) at every `re`;
the naive ones drift up with the shared environment (rg=0.5, re=0.6 → 0.53 vs the
true 0.50), and LDSC's fitted intercept grows with the overlap that the slope then
ignores. Bivariate **LDpred3 with `cross_corr`** is the tightest and most robust
(it models the noise covariance in the likelihood rather than dividing by two
noisy marginal h² estimates — the quantity whose instability inflates LDSC's rg
when a heritability lands near zero). The remaining scatter (±~0.13 at rg=0) is
this small simulation's few-LD-block sampling variance, not a bias.

### Choosing `cross_corr` in practice

The bivariate sampler takes the overlap as `cross_corr` (the cross-trait
sampling-noise correlation). How much it matters and how to set it
(`benchmarks/overlap_estimation.py`):

- **The rg estimate is only mildly sensitive to overlap.** Fitting with
  `cross_corr=0` inflates rg by ~0.01–0.05 even at strong overlap (ρ=0.4) —
  because the model puts the overlap in the noise-covariance term
  `E12 = cross_corr/√(N₁ⱼN₂ⱼ)`, structurally separate from the LD-mediated genetic
  covariance. So `cross_corr=0` is a safe default; supply a value when you want an
  unbiased rg near zero or with large shared control sets.
- **If you know the overlap** (same cohort, documented shared samples), set
  `cross_corr = N_shared·ρ_pheno/√(N₁N₂)` (for fully shared samples, just the
  phenotypic correlation among them).
- **If you don't**, estimate it from the **cross-trait LDSC intercept** —
  `ldpred3.ldsc_rg(...).gcov_intercept`, which
  `ldpred3.estimate_sample_overlap(rg_result, N₁, N₂, pheno_corr)` inverts to a
  shared-sample count. This is the standard estimator and is well-anchored at real
  GWAS scale (millions of SNPs spanning a wide LD-score range); on a small panel
  the intercept is a noisy extrapolation, so treat its sign/magnitude as a
  *detector* there rather than a precise count.
- The overlap **cannot** be read back out of the bivariate sampler itself: fit
  with `cross_corr=0` it absorbs the overlap into (spurious) genetic covariance, so
  the fit residuals carry no overlap signal. Estimate it externally (LDSC) and pass
  it in.
